Course files (.crs) typically go in folders. For example:

* Courses\
  * Examples\
    * TestCourse.crs      - the course file itself
    * TestCourse-bn.png   - the banner for the course
    * TestCourse-bg.png   - the background for the course

Unlike normal StepMania 5, SM5TE doesn't come with any courses.
Since the courses included with StepMania 5 are not static, they can't be
considered "legit" to score on. The support for reading them has not been removed,
and you can re-add the courses if you like.
