StepMania 5 Tournament Edition changelog
----------------------------------------

________[ 2012 ]________________________________________________________________

<pre001>
-(-- 2012/04/22 --)-
* [ProfileManager] Added SaveProfile(PlayerNumber), SaveLocalProfile(stringID),
  ProfileFromMemoryCardIsNew(PlayerNumber), GetSongNumTimesPlayed(Song,ProfileSlot)
  Lua bindings.
* [LifeMeterBar] Fixed life difficulty to act like StepMania 3.9 again.

-(-- 2012/04/21 --)-
* Removed ez2 game mode.

-(-- 2012/04/19 --)-
* [ScreenSongOptions] Added Disqualify object. Since the options on
  ScreenSongOptions are shared between players, the Disqualify notice is also
  shared between players.

-(-- 2012/04/17 --)-
* [RageSoundReader_Vorbisfile] Add code to un-r21 song lengths.
  (currently disabled due to speed hit.)
  This will not change the ogg files themselves, you will need to make any
  permanent changes yourself. ITG Ogg Patch (http://code.google.com/p/itgoggpatch/)
  is one such tool for unpatching songs.

-(-- 2012/04/14 --)-
* [GameManager] Don't allow any steps to be autogen'd.
* [ScreenDebugOverlay] Changed handling of speed functions.
  Tab by itself still speeds up. Holding Shift slows it down. Holding Control and
  Shift at the same time pauses time.
* Changed ToggleConsoleDisplay key to the key above Tab and below Escape (`/~).
* [Player] Added more fixes for manually-set illegal timing windows.
* Disqualification now forced on. (This may change in the future.)
* Remove MonkeyInput.

-(-- 2012/04/12 --)-
* Removed a bunch of logging calls, added LogTextureLoad preference.
* [Player] Removed RollBodyIncrementsCombo metric. Holds no longer increment combo.

* [GameManager] Added GetStepsTypesForGame Lua binding.
